# Structure and Endpoints

Project contain 3 microservioces, Postgress DB, Kafka
Also added Postman collection for testing the APIS

## api-server

1. GET - song - search songs by name of song and artist
2. POST - insertJob - create new Job to add song by song name and artist Used for insert songs in asyncronous job, post request to add song as a producer for message in the tpopic 'insert_song_jobs'
3. GET - insertJobStatus - send an insertJobId to get the status of the proccess from DB with status success or failed and information .
4. Using Middleware to validate request with class validator

## consumer-server

1.  Used to consume as a microservice, to send data from messages into the DB

## Lyrics-server

service that return lyrics for songName - I assume that data will not change so added in-memory cache for it, and with large scale probably will use a more robust solution (such as Redis)

## DB

Handle some DB changes to handle requirements

1. Add PK,SERIAL to index number id. (The index field should be auto generated)
2. Efficent search by adding index for song name+artist
3. Add unique constraint - a song canâ€™t be inserted in case there is already a song with the same name and artist
4. Add new Table insert_song_job for get jobs status and info
